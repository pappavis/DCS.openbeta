The Su-27, NATO codename Flanker, is one of the pillars of modern-day Russian combat aviation. Built to counter the American F-15 Eagle, the Flanker is a twin-engine, supersonic, highly manoeuvrable air superiority fighter. The Flanker is equally capable of engaging targets well beyond visual range as it is in a dogfight given its amazing slow speed and high angle attack manoeuvrability. Using its radar and stealthy infrared search and track system, the Flanker can employ a wide array of radar and infrared guided missiles. The Flanker also includes a helmet-mounted sight that allows you to simply look at a target to lock it up! In addition to its powerful air-to-air capabilities, the Flanker can also be armed with bombs and unguided rockets to fulfil a secondary ground attack role.",

The map measures 267 x 348 kilometers and includes airfields in both Normandy and southern England. The map includes the famous D-Day landing beaches and the \"Atlantic Wall\", rolling bocage fields of Normandy, large cities like Caen and Rouen, ports of Cherbourg and Le Havre, and 30 airfields. The map also includes multiple seasons and more detail and accuracy than any previous DCS World map by utilizing new map technologies. \
\
In addition to being developed to support DCS: World War II modules, other module eras from the Korean War to Modern Day may also be used with this map. \
\
Note: The DCS: World War II Assets Pack is required for inclusion of World War II air, land and sea units. You can order it in Normandy 1944 Map + WWII Assets Pack Bundle. \
